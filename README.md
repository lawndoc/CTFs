# CTFs
A growing collection of CTF challenges. Discussions tab is open for questions/hints. Do NOT spoil the solutions please.

I'm currently looking into a way to automatically validate flags and create a Markdown leaderboard in this repo.

If you'd like to contribute a CTF challenge, please open a pull request and I'll coordinate with you to validate the solution and do a security check.
